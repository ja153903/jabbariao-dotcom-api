# TODOs

- [ ] Figure out if we can add a validation layer before we make entries into the database
- [ ] Create Docker image for test-db with PostgreSQL
- [ ] Create Docker compose file to start running Docker image and also the server
- [ ] Figure out a database solution to run PostgreSQL (most likely using Supabase)
